# emacs

I have been using emacs for quite some time. I will store all my configurations in this repository which is going to be separated into:

- `doom`: Is my current doom configuration (include `.doom.d` and `.emacs.d`)
- `standalone_emacs`: Is used to store my old Emacs plain vanilla configuration

I used spacemacs but I don't think it worth to have it here
